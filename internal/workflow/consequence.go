// Consequence assessment.
//
// A consequence signal is not a verdict. `anchor with severity=critical`, a
// high-risk path and a security namespace all say the same thing: LOOK HARDER
// HERE. None of them says who must decide.
//
// The measurement that forced this: 22 of the 26 files Sensei covers carry
// APPROVAL_GATE_NONE from the risk channel and a consequence blind spot at the
// same time, and ten recorded authority receipts in this repository all name
// the identical pair. Routing the signal straight to a human made the file the
// authority unit, and the file cannot answer the question, because the same
// change carries different consequences depending on what is being DONE with
// it:
//
//	edit internal/event/bus.go in a candidate worktree, run tests
//	  → nothing outside the worktree changes; discard it and the world is unchanged
//
//	merge it, build a release, publish the image, deploy to a cluster
//	  → materially different, and no property of bus.go distinguishes the two
//
// So the unit is the ACTION. This assesses one, and answers only the question
// it can: are the consequences of THIS action bounded.
//
// # The asymmetry that keeps it honest
//
// An assessment draws on two sources and they are not equal.
//
// The STAGE is structural. The engine knows the architect stage runs in an
// isolated candidate worktree whose diff is audited before anything leaves it,
// because that is what the workflow does — not because a provider said so.
//
// Everything the plan DECLARES is a claim. A declared outward effect can only
// make an assessment worse; the absence of one clears nothing. An agent that
// says "no side effects" has supplied no evidence, and an assessment that
// accepted silence as safety would be the escape hatch this whole design
// refuses, one level up from the retrieval silence it already refuses.
